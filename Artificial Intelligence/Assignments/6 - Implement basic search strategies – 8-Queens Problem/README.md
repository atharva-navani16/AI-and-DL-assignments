# Assignment 6: Solving the 8-Queens Problem

This assignment explores the application of basic search algorithms to solve the 8-Queens problem.

## Problem Overview
The challenge of the 8-Queens problem is to place 8 queens on a chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other, meaning no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Backtracking Algorithm:** Systematically places queens and backtracks when conflicts arise.
- **Basic Search Strategies:** Utilized to explore possible board configurations.

## Steps to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run `8_queens.py` to execute the solution and view the placement of the queens.
