# Assignment 3: Building and Querying a Family Tree with a Knowledge Base

This assignment focuses on constructing a family tree and leveraging a knowledge base to parse and query relationships.

## Problem Overview
The task is to represent family relationships in a knowledge base and then use that representation to answer queries about the family structure.

## Tools Implemented
- **Logical Inference Engine:** Performs reasoning based on family relationships.
- **Knowledge Base Parsing:** Parses the family tree data to extract meaningful relationships and allow querying.

## Steps to Run
1. Clone the project repository.
2. Execute `family_tree_parser.py` to construct and query the family tree.
