# Assignment 2: Solving a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)

This assignment explores how to solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) by implementing key algorithms.

## Problem Overview
CSPs are problems where solutions must satisfy a set of constraints. These techniques are widely used in tasks like scheduling, map coloring, and solving logic puzzles.

## Algorithms Used
- **Backtracking Search:** A method to explore possible solutions by trying and eliminating options.
- **Constraint Propagation:** A technique to reduce the search space by enforcing constraints early.

## Steps to Run
1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Execute `csp_solver.py` to solve the given CSP and view the results.
