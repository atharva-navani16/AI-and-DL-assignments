# Assignment 1: Solving the 8-Puzzle Problem

This assignment demonstrates how to solve the 8-puzzle problem using two fundamental search algorithms: Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS).

## Problem Overview
The 8-puzzle is a classic sliding puzzle where the objective is to rearrange numbered tiles in order, with one empty space available to move the tiles around.

## Algorithms Used
- **Depth First Search (DFS):** Explores as deep as possible before backtracking.
- **Breadth First Search (BFS):** Explores all possible moves at the current depth before proceeding deeper.

## Steps to Run the Code
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. For solving the puzzle using DFS, execute `8_puzzle_dfs.py`.
3. To see the BFS approach in action, run `8_puzzle_bfs.py`.
