# Assignment 8: Implementing the Backward Chaining Algorithm

This assignment demonstrates the use of the Backward Chaining algorithm for reasoning and logical decision-making.

## Problem Overview
Backward Chaining is an inference technique where the algorithm starts with a goal or query and works backward through known rules and facts to prove or disprove it.

## Steps to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Execute `backward_chaining.py` to see how the Backward Chaining algorithm works in practice.
