# Assignment 4: Pathfinding with A* Algorithm

This assignment demonstrates how the A* algorithm can be applied to solve pathfinding problems in a weighted graph.

## Problem Overview
The A* algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path between two points by combining cost with a heuristic. This assignment showcases how the algorithm solves pathfinding challenges in various scenarios.

## Algorithm Details
- **A* Search:** Incorporates both actual cost and a heuristic to explore the most promising paths first.

## Steps to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Execute `a_star.py` to run the A* algorithm and observe the pathfinding process.
