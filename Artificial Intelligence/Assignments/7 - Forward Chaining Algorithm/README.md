# Assignment 7: Implementing the Forward Chaining Algorithm

This assignment focuses on applying the Forward Chaining algorithm for reasoning and decision-making in a rule-based system.

## Problem Overview
Forward Chaining is an inference method that starts with known facts and applies rules to derive new facts, making it useful for logical reasoning and decision-making tasks.

## Steps to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Execute `forward_chaining.py` to observe how the Forward Chaining algorithm works in a rule-based system.
