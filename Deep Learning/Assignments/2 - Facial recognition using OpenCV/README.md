# Assignment 2: Facial Recognition with OpenCV and Deep Learning

## Overview
This assignment develops a facial recognition system leveraging OpenCV and deep learning methods. It utilizes a deep learning model to determine whether images contain a face.

## How to Execute
- Install the necessary libraries by executing: `pip install opencv-python`.
- Run the script to conduct facial recognition on a collection of images.

## Files
- `facial_recognition.py`: This file contains the implementation of the facial recognition system using deep learning.
