# Assignment 7: Object Detection with YOLO and Pretrained Models

## Overview
This assignment showcases the use of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for object detection, utilizing pretrained models. The objective is to identify objects in images and categorize them into specified classes.

## How to Execute
- Install the necessary libraries: `pip install opencv-python`.
- Download the pretrained YOLO weights.
- Execute the script to perform object detection in images using YOLO.
