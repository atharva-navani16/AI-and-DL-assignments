# Assignment 1: Feedforward Neural Networks with Keras and TensorFlow

## Overview
This assignment focuses on the implementation of feedforward neural networks (FNN) utilizing Keras and TensorFlow. It illustrates the process of creating, training, and assessing a basic FNN model designed for a classification task.

## How to Execute
- Install the necessary libraries by running: `pip install tensorflow keras`.
- Execute the script to train and evaluate the neural network.

## Files
- `feedforward_nn.py`: This file contains the implementation of the feedforward neural network.​⬤
