# Assignment 3: Image Classification with CNNs

## Overview
This assignment focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to categorize images into various classes. The CNN architecture is constructed using Keras and TensorFlow.

## How to Execute
- First, install the necessary libraries by running: `pip install tensorflow keras`.
- Execute the script to train the CNN model on an image dataset and classify the images.

## Files
- `cnn_image_classification.py`: This file contains the implementation of the CNN for image classification.​⬤
