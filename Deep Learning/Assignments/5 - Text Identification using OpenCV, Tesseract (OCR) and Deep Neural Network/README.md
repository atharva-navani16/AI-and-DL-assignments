# Assignment 5: Text Identification with OpenCV and Deep Neural Networks

## Overview
This assignment employs OpenCV and deep learning methodologies to recognize and extract text from images through Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

## How to Execute
- Start by installing the necessary libraries: `pip install opencv-python tesseract`.
- Execute the script to perform text identification in images.

## Files
- `text_identification.py`: This file contains the implementation for text identification using OpenCV and deep neural networks.​⬤
