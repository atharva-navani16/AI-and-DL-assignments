# Assignment 4: Time Series Prediction with RNNs

## Overview
This assignment showcases the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for predicting time series data, including stock market prices and weather patterns.

## How to Execute
- Begin by installing the required libraries with: `pip install tensorflow keras`.
- Run the script to train the RNN model and carry out time series predictions.

## Files
- `rnn_time_series.py`: This file contains the implementation of the RNN for time series prediction.â€‹
